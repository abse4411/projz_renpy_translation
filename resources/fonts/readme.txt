You can put fonts here, then config your font paths in config.yaml.
We have configed two default fonts, and you can download them from the following links:

DejaVuSans.ttf: https://github.com/renpy/renpy/blob/master/renpy/common/DejaVuSans.ttf
SourceHanSansLite.ttf: https://github.com/renpy/renpy/blob/master/sdk-fonts/SourceHanSansLite.ttf

PS: You SHOULD exercise caution in copyright issues with the use of fonts.
